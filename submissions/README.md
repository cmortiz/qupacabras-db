# Submissions Directory

This directory contains detailed documentation for each quantum algorithm benchmark in the database.

## Structure

Each benchmark has its own folder containing:
- `README.md` - Detailed description and methodology
- Supporting files (analysis scripts, raw data, etc.)

## Example Folders

- `shors_15/` - Shor's algorithm factoring 15
- `grovers_8/` - Grover's search on 8-item database
- `qpe_ising/` - Quantum Phase Estimation on Ising model
- `hhl/` - HHL algorithm implementation
- `qaoa_maxcut/` - QAOA for MaxCut problem

## Contributing
